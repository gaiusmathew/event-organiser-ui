00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.901
THE BODY

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.651
Yes?

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.609
I'll be right there.

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.526
No, I'll take my car.

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.192
I landed 3 hours ago.
I don't mind driving.

00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:59.526
Then we'll go in yours.

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:02.817
Sure, don't be a bore.
Just hang up. See you soon.

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:20.567
It wasn't my idea to call you.
Technically you're on duty...

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:21.651
What happened?

00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:23.442
We're still not sure.

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:26.776
- How was Berlin?
- Fine. What have we got?

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:29.442
A guy got run over,
he's in a coma.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.109
How's Eva?

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:33.067
She's in Berlin.
Tell me what you know.

00:03:33.234 --> 00:03:35.276
You haven't seen your daughter
in 4 years...

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:36.317
2 and a half.

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:38.276
...and you go to Berlin
and fuck it up?

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:41.234
- I didn't fuck it up, it was fine.
- Then why the long face?

00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:45.151
Will you stop busting my balls
and tell me what we're doing here?

00:03:48.317 --> 00:03:52.317
His name's Angel Torres.
Skull injury and cervical fractures.

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:55.984
The doctors have stabilized him
but don't know when he'll come to.

00:03:56.317 --> 00:03:59.192
The driver says he was on the road,

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.151
he couldn't swerve to miss him.

00:04:01.317 --> 00:04:03.109
- Blood alcohol?
- Negative.

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:07.151
We only have his tracks in the woods.
He was running away.

00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:10.151
From what? Why was he running
in the woods at night?

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:12.442
He works at the Forensics Institute.

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.984
The morgue?

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.734
He's the night guard.

00:04:51.817 --> 00:04:54.567
Torres fled his post around 8:30.

00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:57.484
He left via the security fence
and ran through the woods.

00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:00.026
The morgue people told us
that some guards panic

00:05:00.192 --> 00:05:02.651
when the alarms go off
in the refrigerated rooms.

00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:03.942
But that's not the case.

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:08.109
No. Torres has been here for 3 years
and no alarm went off.

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:11.192
All we have is a phone call.

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:13.484
He called us minutes before
he was run over.

00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:16.817
He wanted a patrol car to come.
He was jumpy and didn't say why.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.276
They put him through to Carlos,
who was on duty,

00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:22.859
but he'd already gone.
They called again, but no reply.

00:05:23.026 --> 00:05:25.192
- Why?
- We don't know.

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:26.859
Was anyone else in the building?

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:31.526
The doors to the morgue shut at 8.
Torres is the only night staff.

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:34.984
So we have no fucking idea
what happened.

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:38.192
The only reason the guard
may have panicked and run off

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:40.067
is some kind of sick joke.

00:05:40.234 --> 00:05:43.567
According to the register,
a body is missing.

00:05:53.526 --> 00:05:56.817
The missing body is a woman,
Mayka Villaverde.

00:05:56.984 --> 00:06:00.984
Cause of death: Heart attack.
Autopsy pending.

00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:03.067
Who signed the death certificate?

00:06:03.234 --> 00:06:06.984
Dr. Tapia. No other forensic
had contact with the body.

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.067
We've already informed her.

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:32.942
The circuit's been disconnected.

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:35.442
All the cameras are out except one.

00:06:36.276 --> 00:06:37.692
I've paused the recording.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.776
Something's grabbed his attention.
No alarm went off,

00:06:44.942 --> 00:06:48.109
so we think this is when
the security cameras went out.

00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:51.317
He left his post for 5 minutes.

00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:53.901
When he came back,
this is what happened.

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:09.109
All the cameras are out except one.

00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:10.859
Why?

00:07:12.234 --> 00:07:16.192
Whoever did this is inept
or is playing with us.

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:17.817
You think he's still here?

00:07:17.984 --> 00:07:21.776
I don't know,
but I want the building surrounded.

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.609
The woods too.

00:07:24.401 --> 00:07:26.567
Take care of it. Okay, Norma?

00:07:29.192 --> 00:07:32.151
Something happened
to make the guard to run away,

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:34.984
and unless we believe
the dead can walk,

00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:37.192
someone got in
and stole the corpse.

00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:40.192
- Are you sure no one broke in?
- No. I'm quite sure.

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:43.567
But we can't get into
the security room,

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:45.567
someone's changed the code.

00:07:45.734 --> 00:07:47.442
The science team.

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:52.609
- You talk to them.
- Okay.

00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:56.859
What do we know about her?

00:07:57.359 --> 00:08:00.692
Married to Alex Ulloa,
director of Farmatech,

00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:03.984
a pharmaceutical lab
that she owns.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:08.859
She also had controlling shares
in some thriving technological firms.

00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:11.026
No children.

00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:15.109
And she owned other businesses
with her two sisters,

00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:18.442
Luna and Gloria Villaverde.

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:22.984
The report says she just came back
from a business trip to L.A.

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:25.942
A powerful woman.

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:28.817
Mayka Villaverde Freire,

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.567
do you take Alex Ulloa Marcos

00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:35.401
as your lawful wedded husband
till death do you part?

00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:38.609
No.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.401
I don't want to marry you, Alex.

00:08:48.026 --> 00:08:50.609
- What do you mean?
- Not like this.

00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:53.401
My whole family's here!

00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:56.567
Mayka, please...

00:08:58.734 --> 00:09:00.151
Darling!

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:02.067
Of course I do!

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:13.692
Only she could do that
and get us to applaud.

00:09:14.942 --> 00:09:16.526
And the groom to kiss her.

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:19.859
I'll get it.

00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:23.734
Yes?

00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:25.526
Hello, Dad.

00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:28.609
No, you'd better call him tomorrow.

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.692
He's in the bedroom.
He doesn't want to talk to anyone.

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:33.192
He's shattered.

00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:38.734
He found her
when he got back from the lab.

00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:40.692
A heart attack.

00:09:41.026 --> 00:09:43.651
Mum's dress was perfect on her.

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:46.276
Mayka was perfect.

00:09:46.442 --> 00:09:48.276
You may kiss the bride

00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:04.734
Alex.

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.734
Alex.

00:10:12.609 --> 00:10:15.776
Dad called.
He sends you a kiss.

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:21.734
We'll leave you alone, okay?

00:10:23.609 --> 00:10:25.276
I need to rest.

00:11:34.692 --> 00:11:36.109
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't take any more.

00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:38.859
- You could've called.
- Nobody saw me.

00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:41.067
Is something wrong?

00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:47.109
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.

00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:50.276
- It's done. I did it for you.
- There's no going back.

00:11:51.026 --> 00:11:53.401
I'm free to be with you.
We're free.

00:12:10.109 --> 00:12:13.109
- What can I get you?
- I don't care, whatever you're having.

00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:22.859
What were you doing?

00:12:23.026 --> 00:12:24.026
Nothing.

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:28.651
Thinking.

00:12:28.817 --> 00:12:31.317
- About what?
- What do you think?

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:01.067
Why don't you answer it?

00:13:01.234 --> 00:13:04.151
I don't know who it is.
The condolences keep coming.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.234
It's unbearable.

00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:07.942
At this hour?

00:13:11.609 --> 00:13:12.734
Yes?

00:13:14.109 --> 00:13:15.692
Yes, that's me.

00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:18.401
Don't worry, I was awake.

00:13:19.442 --> 00:13:22.776
I spoke to your colleague.
This afternoon, yes.

00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:38.984
What do you mean "disappeared"?

00:13:40.692 --> 00:13:42.276
That's impossible, it's...

00:13:45.942 --> 00:13:47.942
Alright, alright. Thanks.

00:13:48.234 --> 00:13:49.734
I'll be right there.

00:13:50.734 --> 00:13:53.026
- Who was that?
- The police.

00:13:53.192 --> 00:13:56.234
- Didn't you speak to them already?
- Mayka's disappeared.

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:57.109
What?

00:13:57.276 --> 00:14:00.151
Her body's disappeared
from the morgue.

00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:02.817
- Disappeared? How?
- Disappeared. I don't know.

00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:05.692
- She is dead, isn't she?
- Of course she is.

00:14:05.859 --> 00:14:07.317
Are you sure?

00:14:08.859 --> 00:14:11.484
I know what I did and how.
She's dead.

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:13.692
Someone must've taken her.

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:16.859
I don't know, I only know
what the police are saying.

00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:22.151
Maybe it's a mistake,
they'll probably apologize.

00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:32.859
- Do you have to go?
- Of course I do.

00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:35.359
Don't go.

00:14:36.234 --> 00:14:39.567
It might be dangerous. What if
they're suspicious and it's a trap?

00:14:39.734 --> 00:14:42.192
They've no reason to be suspicious.

00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:44.442
But if I don't go, they might be.

00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:46.609
Come here.

00:14:49.692 --> 00:14:50.901
Be careful.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:02.984
Go on, you can go through.

00:15:12.276 --> 00:15:16.234
We're sorry to call you
with such terrible news

00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:18.859
and for getting you down here.
Thank you so much.

00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:21.442
What's happened, exactly?

00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:25.609
Our first hypothesis...

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:29.442
is that someone's taken the body.

00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:32.984
How can this happen?

00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:36.901
Isn't this place meant to be secure?
There are human beings here.

00:15:37.067 --> 00:15:39.067
There's 24-hour surveillance.

00:15:39.234 --> 00:15:42.734
It's what happened to
the night guard that alerted us.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.109
He was run over
as he fled the morgue in fear.

00:15:46.276 --> 00:15:47.276
In fear?

00:15:47.442 --> 00:15:50.942
It seems he saw something
related to your wife's disappearance.

00:15:51.109 --> 00:15:52.651
We don't know what.

00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:54.859
He ran away
and was run over by a car.

00:15:55.026 --> 00:15:56.984
He's now in a coma
at Sacred Heart.

00:15:57.151 --> 00:15:59.859
Where's the sense in this?
Has it happened before?

00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:03.692
There have been cases of vandalism
and organ trafficking,

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:05.692
but we ruled those out.

00:16:05.984 --> 00:16:08.317
Vandals leave all kinds of traces

00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:12.151
and organ traffickers
don't take just one body.

00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:16.817
And, no offense, but usually
they prefer younger bodies.

00:16:18.942 --> 00:16:22.901
That leaves us
a Satanic cult, a sect.

00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:27.359
Your wife didn't look like
a sect member.

00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:29.484
No, of course not.

00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:35.026
Then it has to be more personal...

00:16:38.026 --> 00:16:42.401
someone wishing to harm your wife,
even after she was dead.

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:46.567
Did she have problems with anyone,
enemies of any kind?

00:16:46.942 --> 00:16:48.942
Mayka didn't have any problems
with anyone.

00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:51.567
She was a powerful woman,
owned companies.

00:16:51.734 --> 00:16:52.901
You can't think of anyone?

00:16:53.067 --> 00:16:54.984
To do something so horrific,
of course not.

00:16:55.442 --> 00:16:56.442
What about you?

00:16:57.984 --> 00:16:58.984
What about me?

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:02.984
It sounds twisted,
but would anyone want to hurt you

00:17:03.151 --> 00:17:05.651
with something as macabre
as making your wife vanish?

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:08.901
I've no idea why this is happening.
I have no enemies.

00:17:09.067 --> 00:17:13.567
If it's not you, perhaps they want
to hurt some family member.

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:16.859
- You should ask Mayka's sisters.
- We've done that.

00:17:17.942 --> 00:17:19.276
Did you call them before me?

00:17:19.442 --> 00:17:23.567
We located them at home,
but neither of them knows anything.

00:17:24.817 --> 00:17:27.026
The lawyer...

00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:28.859
Gloria.

00:17:30.151 --> 00:17:32.192
...gave us these papers.

00:17:32.984 --> 00:17:34.984
We might find something,
and we might not.

00:17:36.609 --> 00:17:39.776
Of course we tried to find you first,

00:17:39.942 --> 00:17:41.276
but you weren't home,

00:17:41.817 --> 00:17:44.317
so we called your mobile.

00:17:44.859 --> 00:17:46.859
Gloria gave us your number.

00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:51.067
I went out for some painkillers,
my head was about to explode.

00:17:53.276 --> 00:17:54.609
Feeling any better?

00:17:55.401 --> 00:17:56.984
Yes. Thanks a lot.

00:18:00.192 --> 00:18:01.984
Dr. Tapia's here.

00:18:07.817 --> 00:18:09.484
We'll be right back.

00:18:34.151 --> 00:18:34.984
Yes?

00:18:35.151 --> 00:18:36.651
Why didn't you pick up?

00:18:36.817 --> 00:18:40.067
I'm sorry, I thought the police
might have your mobile.

00:18:40.234 --> 00:18:42.109
Nobody took my mobile.
Everything's fine.

00:18:42.276 --> 00:18:43.192
Has she turned up?

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:45.442
No, but she will.
I need you to do something.

00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:47.276
What do you want me to do?

00:18:47.442 --> 00:18:49.859
The guard saw something,
ran away and got run over.

00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:51.692
He's unconscious in Intensive Care.

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:54.984
The police say they don't know
what he saw, but I don't trust them.

00:18:55.151 --> 00:18:56.817
Do you know anyone
at Sacred Heart?

00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:58.734
Alex, what are you asking?

00:18:58.901 --> 00:19:01.234
The guard's there.
Do you know someone or not?

00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:03.234
I did practicals there last year.

00:19:03.401 --> 00:19:06.692
Go there and find out what you can
without raising any suspicion.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:09.234
Can't you go?
You must know people at their lab.

00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:10.692
I can't move from here.

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.526
- Are you under arrest?
- Of course not.

00:19:14.692 --> 00:19:18.192
But they want to question me.
I'll call when I can. Love you. Ciao.

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.317
I love you t...

00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:35.817
You can't smoke here.

00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:38.692
In this situation
can't you turn a blind eye?

00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:41.317
The forensic wants to talk to you.

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:44.859
In your statement you say

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:48.026
your wife returned from L.A.
this morning. Is that right?

00:19:48.192 --> 00:19:50.942
- Yes. A business trip.
- I see she had a fear of flying.

00:19:51.109 --> 00:19:54.067
She'd done various therapies. Why?

00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:58.109
Stress on long flights
can cause cardiac arrest.

00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:02.192
You think Mayka had a cardiac
because of the trip?

00:20:02.526 --> 00:20:04.317
There is that possibility.

00:20:04.484 --> 00:20:08.484
Though we have no record
of any cardiovascular hazard.

00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:10.859
Perhaps it wasn't detected.

00:20:11.026 --> 00:20:14.151
I don't know, you're the expert.

00:20:14.984 --> 00:20:18.567
Mayka thought she was invincible.
Perhaps that takes its toll.

00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:22.567
Perhaps.

00:20:28.692 --> 00:20:31.609
But without an autopsy
it's impossible to verify.

00:20:32.109 --> 00:20:33.984
Any schizophrenic episode?

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:35.776
No.

00:20:35.942 --> 00:20:37.692
- Parkinson's?
- Not that either.

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:38.817
Epilepsy?

00:20:38.984 --> 00:20:41.401
It's all in her medical file.
I don't get it.

00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:44.442
The doctors didn't live with her.
You did.

00:20:44.609 --> 00:20:47.442
I don't get what this has to do
with my wife's disappearance.

00:20:48.526 --> 00:20:51.442
I'd like to rule out a theory
that'd explain what happened.

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:53.984
What?

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:56.526
Catalepsy.

00:20:56.692 --> 00:20:58.192
What did you say?

00:21:06.984 --> 00:21:08.192
Alright, Silvia...

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:11.901
Do you really think it's possible
the corpse wasn't a corpse?

00:21:12.067 --> 00:21:14.859
I certified her death
and I did my job properly,

00:21:15.026 --> 00:21:17.526
but circumstances force me
to reconsider everything.

00:21:17.692 --> 00:21:19.651
It makes no sense.
If she woke up,

00:21:19.817 --> 00:21:22.234
why not cry out for help?
Why disappear?

00:21:22.401 --> 00:21:25.567
He's right. It's more logical
that someone came for her.

00:21:25.734 --> 00:21:28.109
And from a medical viewpoint,
more probable.

00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:31.859
Then let's return to the 21st century
and assume that the cause of death

00:21:32.026 --> 00:21:35.151
was heart attack,
as in your preliminary report.

00:21:35.317 --> 00:21:38.817
The question is:
Why was the body taken?

00:21:40.026 --> 00:21:42.942
There's a principle
in forensic medicine:

00:21:43.484 --> 00:21:46.817
"Every death is a homicide
until proven otherwise."

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:49.651
Cardiac arrest can be induced

00:21:49.817 --> 00:21:52.276
by submitting a person
to extreme tension.

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:56.192
Or administering substances
that have the same result.

00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:59.442
But nothing's demonstrable
without an autopsy.

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:02.109
And no body, no autopsy.

00:22:11.109 --> 00:22:13.526
What did you think
when you spoke to him?

00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:17.276
I was surprised
how he referred to his wife.

00:22:17.734 --> 00:22:20.817
He spoke about her in the past,
with no hesitation.

00:22:21.276 --> 00:22:23.776
Ruth died several years ago...

00:22:24.567 --> 00:22:27.567
and I still talk about her
as if she were alive.

00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:34.276
His wife died this afternoon.

00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:38.276
I'll find out everything about him.

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:59.609
I'm sorry you had to come
at this time of night.

00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:03.401
And in this weather.

00:23:03.776 --> 00:23:06.526
Pablo tells me you came back
from a trip today,

00:23:06.692 --> 00:23:08.276
to see Eva.

00:23:11.776 --> 00:23:13.234
I hope she's alright.

00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:14.942
She's fine.

00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:16.692
Or seems to be at least.

00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:18.984
And you?

00:23:20.317 --> 00:23:21.901
How are you?

00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:24.151
They told you everything.

00:23:24.984 --> 00:23:27.151
I heard you were suspended again,

00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:29.401
you went into therapy again...

00:23:29.567 --> 00:23:31.317
I fell off the wagon.

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:34.401
But I only drink coffee now.

00:23:34.567 --> 00:23:37.817
7 months on coffee,
I'm a gourmet about it.

00:23:38.192 --> 00:23:40.317
Try switching to teas.

00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:42.484
Your heart will thank you.

00:23:42.651 --> 00:23:45.484
My heart's withstood much worse.

00:23:46.984 --> 00:23:50.276
You'd be doing yourself a favour
if you put it behind you.

00:23:50.442 --> 00:23:52.776
When will you stop blaming yourself?

00:23:52.942 --> 00:23:54.776
It's been a long time.

00:23:56.526 --> 00:23:58.651
It was a night like tonight.

00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:06.192
I'm alone now, Silvia.

00:24:08.692 --> 00:24:09.692
No.

00:24:12.151 --> 00:24:13.567
You're not.

00:24:24.776 --> 00:24:26.151
What's wrong?

00:24:26.817 --> 00:24:29.692
- Where is everyone?
- Go back inside.

00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:31.609
- Have you seen the time?
- Yeah.

00:24:31.776 --> 00:24:34.276
- You know what a day I've had?
- We're working on...

00:24:34.442 --> 00:24:37.984
Listen, please.
Tell your boss I want to go home.

00:24:38.192 --> 00:24:39.776
Be patient.

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.359
I'll see what's happening.

00:24:47.734 --> 00:24:49.317
Please, call your boss.

00:24:49.484 --> 00:24:52.192
Please, Mr. Ulloa,
go back into the office.

00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:53.901
Thank you.

00:27:28.151 --> 00:27:29.401
Mayka.

00:27:34.526 --> 00:27:35.817
Thanks.

00:27:38.317 --> 00:27:39.734
What about yours?

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:43.526
- It's 9 in the morning.
- Not in Los Angeles.

00:27:44.234 --> 00:27:46.984
And I want to toast
to the trip's success.

00:27:48.692 --> 00:27:49.984
And...

00:27:51.234 --> 00:27:52.734
...to my return.

00:28:02.442 --> 00:28:05.109
- Will this toast do you?
- No.

00:28:05.942 --> 00:28:08.817
The lab called, I have to go.

00:28:10.109 --> 00:28:11.401
Alex...

00:28:12.317 --> 00:28:16.026
We've been apart for 3 weeks.
We have to talk.

00:28:16.526 --> 00:28:17.692
I've got a meeting.

00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:23.484
You're the Director,
you can do what you like.

00:28:23.651 --> 00:28:25.317
No one can fire you.

00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:29.109
Except me.

00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:31.859
You know something?

00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:34.401
I don't like this kind of joke.

00:28:34.776 --> 00:28:38.026
I work hard because
I take what I do very seriously.

00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:40.067
And I do it because I like it.

00:28:40.901 --> 00:28:42.067
I know.

00:28:42.901 --> 00:28:47.192
That's why you're where you are,
and not teaching at a college.

00:28:47.776 --> 00:28:49.401
I don't want to leave angry.

00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:53.609
See you later, okay?

00:29:38.817 --> 00:29:40.567
Hello. Cristina?

00:29:41.151 --> 00:29:44.151
Please call and tell them
Alex can't make the meeting.

00:29:44.901 --> 00:29:46.901
No, he's fine.

00:29:47.026 --> 00:29:48.776
Mayka...
What are you doing?

00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:51.817
What's more, he won't be
returning to the lab.

00:29:51.984 --> 00:29:53.442
Get a letter of dismissal
ready for him.

00:29:53.526 --> 00:29:54.776
Mayka... Mayka!

00:29:55.192 --> 00:29:56.317
Of course!

00:29:56.484 --> 00:29:59.151
- What are you doing?
- Of course I'm serious.

00:29:59.317 --> 00:30:02.734
It's my company. It's my decision
and I've just made it.

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.817
Thanks.

00:30:08.901 --> 00:30:10.692
We'll sort it out this afternoon,

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:13.984
but now we have
the whole morning to ourselves.

00:30:14.151 --> 00:30:15.276
Come here...

00:30:16.359 --> 00:30:17.567
Alex?

00:30:23.984 --> 00:30:25.192
Darling!

00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:27.484
I didn't speak to anyone!

00:30:29.026 --> 00:30:30.984
You're like a child.

00:30:35.234 --> 00:30:38.151
I'll book a table somewhere
for dinner when you get out.

00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:42.734
You'll be sleepy...

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.442
from the jet lag.

00:30:45.776 --> 00:30:47.609
I'll be awake.

00:30:48.234 --> 00:30:50.401
Tell me when you want the table.

00:30:51.567 --> 00:30:53.109
Tonight...

00:30:54.776 --> 00:30:56.984
Tonight you will be mine.

00:31:08.109 --> 00:31:10.609
- Why'd you leave the office?
- What are you doing here?

00:31:11.276 --> 00:31:13.526
I heard a noise.

00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:17.151
The fuses blew,
but it's fixed now.

00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:18.609
What...?

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:24.359
It's the box with
the deceased's personal items.

00:31:26.276 --> 00:31:27.901
They were in this locker.

00:31:32.484 --> 00:31:34.276
The lock's been jimmied.

00:31:36.484 --> 00:31:38.776
Were you searching through
your wife's things?

00:31:38.942 --> 00:31:40.984
No, I didn't touch anything.

00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:45.526
According to the delivery note,
the mobile phone's missing.

00:31:46.192 --> 00:31:47.526
It was in here.

00:31:47.901 --> 00:31:49.442
I didn't take anything.

00:31:49.609 --> 00:31:51.317
Who was it then?

00:31:51.484 --> 00:31:52.776
One of the dead?

00:31:52.942 --> 00:31:55.692
They got bored
and wanted to liven up our night?

00:31:56.192 --> 00:31:58.067
Empty your pockets.

00:32:01.109 --> 00:32:03.609
Why would I take my wife's mobile?

00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:09.609
Please, Mr. Ulloa.

00:32:14.276 --> 00:32:16.776
Incredible. Incredible.

00:32:28.067 --> 00:32:29.484
My phone.

00:32:30.442 --> 00:32:31.776
Thanks.

00:32:33.942 --> 00:32:34.776
Is that it?

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.401
Arms up.

00:32:45.609 --> 00:32:48.317
- What?
- Do as I say.

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.692
- Why?
- I'm going to search you.

00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:51.901
No.

00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:54.609
- Turn around.
- You've got no right.

00:32:54.776 --> 00:32:56.192
Turn around! Fuck!

00:32:57.692 --> 00:33:01.276
What is this? What?

00:33:01.442 --> 00:33:04.651
- You've got no right.
- Fucking turn around!

00:33:04.817 --> 00:33:05.442
Jaime!

00:33:28.151 --> 00:33:28.984
What's this?

00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:31.692
It was on the floor.
I was going to throw it out.

00:33:31.859 --> 00:33:34.401
No recycling? That's not nice.

00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:37.817
It has your lab's seal on it.

00:33:37.984 --> 00:33:41.234
Our products go to these places.
Any cabinet will be full of them.

00:33:41.401 --> 00:33:44.276
- What's TH-16?
- A toxin.

00:33:44.442 --> 00:33:45.109
What kind?

00:33:45.276 --> 00:33:47.317
I don't know,
we work with hundreds of them.

00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.401
- What's it for?
- It'll have various applications.

00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:51.692
- Like what?
- It's not my specialty.

00:33:57.526 --> 00:33:58.942
It's his.

00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:06.234
Answer it.

00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:08.859
My sister.

00:34:12.734 --> 00:34:13.734
Yes?

00:34:13.901 --> 00:34:15.692
I'm at the hospital.
The guard's name is Ángel Torres.

00:34:15.859 --> 00:34:19.067
I'm fine. Mayka's still missing,
but the police will find her.

00:34:19.234 --> 00:34:22.234
You can't talk. Something's wrong,
I can hear it in your voice.

00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:24.484
Thanks, Erica. I'll call you later.

00:34:26.026 --> 00:34:27.651
Have we finished?

00:34:28.192 --> 00:34:31.026
We'll go over your statement,
then you can go home.

00:34:31.192 --> 00:34:32.817
Can I go to the bathroom first?

00:34:36.692 --> 00:34:38.067
I'll wait here.

00:34:45.859 --> 00:34:46.609
Alex..

00:34:46.776 --> 00:34:48.692
I haven't much time.
What did you find out?

00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:51.901
The guard's still unconscious,
they only know what you were told.

00:34:52.067 --> 00:34:53.692
I know a nurse on that floor.

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:56.151
She thinks I'm spending the night
with a relative.

00:34:56.317 --> 00:35:00.401
She's on a break in 20 minutes
I'm meeting her in a bar nearby

00:35:00.567 --> 00:35:02.109
I think somebody knows something.

00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:06.442
- Who? The police?
- The police don't worry me.

00:35:06.609 --> 00:35:09.984
Someone forced the locker with
Mayka's things and taken her phone.

00:35:10.151 --> 00:35:11.567
Fuck.

00:35:11.984 --> 00:35:15.901
And the TH-16 I hid today
has turned up. The police have it.

00:35:16.067 --> 00:35:17.442
It's a trap.

00:35:17.609 --> 00:35:20.151
- I told you not to go.
- I can handle the police.

00:35:20.317 --> 00:35:23.984
How could anyone know anything?
Only you and I knew.

00:35:25.317 --> 00:35:26.734
Did you talk to anyone?

00:35:26.901 --> 00:35:28.984
- What?
- I need to know

00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:30.901
I didn't talk to anyone,
I'm not an idiot.

00:35:31.067 --> 00:35:32.901
Something's gone wrong.
I know what I'm doing.

00:35:33.067 --> 00:35:35.901
You lived with her. Your wife saw you
every day since you decided.

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:39.567
We decided.
I've calculated my every move.

00:35:39.734 --> 00:35:41.942
Maybe you talk in your sleep,
I don't know!

00:35:42.484 --> 00:35:43.317
What'll you do?

00:35:43.484 --> 00:35:46.026
Try to get out of here.
But think about what I said.

00:35:46.192 --> 00:35:49.109
We have to find out what happened
to Mayka and why. Alright?

00:35:49.442 --> 00:35:51.359
Alright. Alex...

00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:53.817
I love you.

00:35:54.317 --> 00:35:56.276
And I love you.

00:36:12.234 --> 00:36:13.776
Dr. Tapia told me.

00:36:14.817 --> 00:36:16.776
I'm sorry I didn't remember...

00:36:18.151 --> 00:36:19.442
...about Ruth.

00:36:22.151 --> 00:36:24.734
Why don't you go home?
I'll cover for you, nobody'll know.

00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:26.651
I lost it before.

00:36:27.567 --> 00:36:29.276
It won't happen again.

00:36:29.442 --> 00:36:31.692
That's what you said last time.

00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:46.526
BUSINESS CLUB ANNUAL DINNER
HOTEL TIVOLI, 8:30

00:37:49.192 --> 00:37:51.942
I CLOSE MY EYES
AND YOU'RE STILL WITH ME

00:38:28.859 --> 00:38:30.692
I expected you earlier.

00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:35.234
Don't tell me...

00:38:35.776 --> 00:38:39.442
- You forgot about the dinner.
- There was a setback at the lab.

00:38:41.067 --> 00:38:44.901
I called. Cristina said you weren't
at the lab all afternoon.

00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:46.276
I went to get some samples.

00:38:46.442 --> 00:38:49.234
I was out of the office
and I couldn't advise Cristina.

00:38:49.401 --> 00:38:51.026
I also called your mobile.

00:38:51.817 --> 00:38:55.151
It was in my briefcase.
I left it in my car.

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:59.151
I didn't see your calls, sorry.

00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:01.734
Hold on.

00:39:02.942 --> 00:39:04.526
You have something...

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.859
- What?
- Here.

00:39:09.567 --> 00:39:12.151
A freckle I've never seen before.

00:39:15.234 --> 00:39:18.651
Put on that grey suit I got you.
You'll look so handsome.

00:39:18.817 --> 00:39:22.026
I was going to wear
the new blue one.

00:39:23.317 --> 00:39:26.026
I'll have a shower.
We can leave in 5 minutes.

00:39:34.234 --> 00:39:36.109
I find it hard to accept...

00:39:46.526 --> 00:39:48.192
...that I'm not so young anymore.

00:39:49.442 --> 00:39:52.151
- We all get older.
- Sure.

00:39:52.567 --> 00:39:55.984
But you're the one
who's starting to get home late.

00:39:58.609 --> 00:40:01.942
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. The song made me sad.

00:40:05.401 --> 00:40:07.401
It made me think about us.

00:40:08.359 --> 00:40:10.151
And that makes you sad?

00:40:10.317 --> 00:40:11.942
The idea of losing you...

00:40:12.442 --> 00:40:13.901
...makes me sad.

00:40:15.192 --> 00:40:18.151
- That's what the song's about.
- Tell me it's just a song!

00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:20.901
It's just a song.

00:40:21.067 --> 00:40:22.984
Tell me I'm not going to lose you.

00:40:24.192 --> 00:40:26.776
You'll never lose me, ever.

00:40:27.567 --> 00:40:28.984
Never.

00:41:20.984 --> 00:41:24.609
I CLOSE MY EYES
AND YOU'RE STILL WITH ME.

00:42:11.817 --> 00:42:12.942
Mr. Ulloa?

00:42:18.484 --> 00:42:20.692
- What are you doing?
- I'm nauseous.

00:42:23.401 --> 00:42:26.484
You have to come with me,
we have news.

00:42:34.192 --> 00:42:35.984
What the hell are you doing?

00:42:38.234 --> 00:42:39.359
Fuck.

00:42:44.692 --> 00:42:46.192
Are you smoking?

00:42:46.359 --> 00:42:49.692
- I'll be right out.
- You now you can't smoke here?

00:42:50.984 --> 00:42:52.192
Come out now, please.

00:42:54.776 --> 00:42:55.859
I'm coming.

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:00.567
What is it?

00:43:00.734 --> 00:43:02.442
A clue.

00:43:17.276 --> 00:43:19.734
- Got the new code yet?
- I'm offended you ask.

00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:22.317
Jaime's inside now.
Pablo's still on the rooftop.

00:43:22.484 --> 00:43:23.817
This way, Mr. Ulloa.

00:43:37.234 --> 00:43:38.942
What do you want me to see?

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:41.026
The inspector will fill you in.

00:43:42.567 --> 00:43:44.151
Where are we?

00:43:53.484 --> 00:43:56.192
The whole building
is controlled from here.

00:43:57.317 --> 00:43:59.317
The security cameras too.

00:44:00.276 --> 00:44:01.942
But there's a weak spot.

00:44:11.234 --> 00:44:14.817
The air duct leads to the rooftop.

00:44:16.442 --> 00:44:18.859
It's been forced at both ends.

00:44:19.234 --> 00:44:22.942
Someone got in here
to cut the surveillance circuits.

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:26.317
He could've reached the fridge
and taken your wife's body.

00:44:26.484 --> 00:44:28.567
- Pablo, do you read me?
- Norma, what is it?

00:44:28.734 --> 00:44:31.901
I'm at the emergency stairs
leading to the rooftop.

00:44:33.276 --> 00:44:34.942
We've found something.

00:44:35.692 --> 00:44:37.526
20 March, 2012.

00:44:38.484 --> 00:44:40.526
Does that date mean anything to you?

00:44:41.942 --> 00:44:43.276
No. Why?

00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:46.609
Someone changed the date
on the calendar.

00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:53.359
Most likely the person
who took your wife's body.

00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:58.692
From here the only way out
is this security door.

00:44:58.859 --> 00:45:00.692
To do that,
you have to key in a code.

00:45:01.276 --> 00:45:04.026
The control panel's been manipulated.

00:45:05.484 --> 00:45:07.734
The code was changed tonight.

00:45:08.776 --> 00:45:10.192
Guess what it is.

00:45:11.276 --> 00:45:15.276
20-03-2012.

00:45:19.484 --> 00:45:21.442
Access granted.

00:45:49.567 --> 00:45:52.817
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
AT THE RESTAURANT - CARLA.

00:45:58.567 --> 00:46:00.026
Fuck, Mayka...

00:46:02.776 --> 00:46:04.234
What are you doing here?

00:46:04.901 --> 00:46:07.276
Nice to see you too.

00:46:07.734 --> 00:46:09.651
Cristina opened up for me.

00:46:10.151 --> 00:46:12.442
Don't you dare get mad at her.

00:46:12.942 --> 00:46:15.109
I thought you were
coming back tomorrow.

00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:18.609
I squeezed the meetings
into one day.

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:21.192
I have to make a note
before I forget.

00:46:27.192 --> 00:46:28.609
I saw you.

00:46:31.442 --> 00:46:33.234
Keying in the code.

00:46:33.942 --> 00:46:35.026
Were you spying on me?

00:46:36.234 --> 00:46:37.942
Why did you choose that date?

00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:39.609
How do you know it's a date?

00:46:39.776 --> 00:46:41.359
Darling...

00:46:43.067 --> 00:46:45.359
You put dates on everything.

00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:49.109
Even the bad days.

00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:54.026
It's a way of remembering.

00:46:54.192 --> 00:46:56.026
Some things are best forgotten.

00:46:56.192 --> 00:46:57.734
I like to remember.

00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:09.359
Are you going to tell me
what happened that day?

00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:12.109
We argued, and you know
I don't like arguing with you.

00:47:12.276 --> 00:47:14.817
I don't like
being contradicted either.

00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:23.817
Shall we have lunch?

00:47:27.401 --> 00:47:30.192
- You've got plans.
- You should've warned me.

00:47:30.776 --> 00:47:33.401
I can have lunch with you
and your plans.

00:47:33.567 --> 00:47:35.692
I'll cancel them
on the way to the restaurant.

00:47:35.901 --> 00:47:38.151
- Shall we go in your car?
- No.

00:47:46.734 --> 00:47:48.276
Trust me.

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:52.734
What are you doing?

00:47:55.026 --> 00:47:56.901
Beautiful day, isn't it?

00:48:00.234 --> 00:48:03.276
From now on I want us to enjoy
every beautiful day...

00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:06.067
...like this.

00:48:08.567 --> 00:48:09.651
Mayka...

00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:12.526
It's the one you liked.

00:48:13.651 --> 00:48:15.359
Black and chrome.

00:48:15.526 --> 00:48:17.859
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

00:48:18.192 --> 00:48:19.942
Cristina has the helmets.

00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:22.151
I want you to take
the first ride with me...

00:48:22.776 --> 00:48:24.026
...now.

00:48:29.317 --> 00:48:31.401
Whoever took your wife's body

00:48:31.567 --> 00:48:34.484
got up to the morgue
via this goods lift.

00:48:34.776 --> 00:48:37.526
And got the body out
using the same lift.

00:48:38.067 --> 00:48:40.067
So, mystery solved.

00:48:42.984 --> 00:48:45.817
We just need to find out who it was.

00:48:46.567 --> 00:48:48.026
Do you have a clue?

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:51.692
I've just been told that footprints
have been found

00:48:51.859 --> 00:48:54.651
near the emergency stairs
going up to the rooftop.

00:48:56.484 --> 00:48:58.067
What's your shoe size?

00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:02.567
- What?
- What's your shoe size?

00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:04.817
42.

00:49:12.234 --> 00:49:15.484
Mateos here.
What the hell's going on?

00:49:29.359 --> 00:49:30.567
Mateos, do you read me?

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:34.442
A fire somewhere in the building
set the alarms off.

00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:36.192
Shit, man.

00:49:38.234 --> 00:49:39.651
Everyone to the lobby.

00:49:41.317 --> 00:49:42.526
Come on. Oh, shit.

00:49:42.692 --> 00:49:43.942
Fuck!

00:49:44.276 --> 00:49:45.276
Let's go!

00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:47.151
This way.

00:50:04.942 --> 00:50:06.401
Carla, I can't talk now.

00:50:06.567 --> 00:50:08.901
- Are you still there?
- Don't call again It's dangerous.

00:50:09.067 --> 00:50:10.067
Why?

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:13.942
Where are you?
What's that noise?

00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:15.359
In the car.

00:50:15.526 --> 00:50:18.276
I went out for a smoke.
The guard's still unconscious.

00:50:18.442 --> 00:50:19.276
What's going on?

00:50:19.442 --> 00:50:21.609
I saw the numbers
on the security camera.

00:50:21.776 --> 00:50:23.359
It's the date when we met.

00:50:25.317 --> 00:50:28.817
What security camera, Alex?
What are you saying? The date...?

00:50:29.442 --> 00:50:30.692
Alex, are you still there?

00:50:33.942 --> 00:50:35.901
Fuck, talk to me! Please!

00:50:36.067 --> 00:50:37.026
Alex!

00:50:37.192 --> 00:50:38.776
I can feel her.

00:50:42.484 --> 00:50:43.942
Mayka's still alive.

00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:47.234
- You said that was impossible.
- You were right. I made a mistake.

00:50:47.401 --> 00:50:49.026
She's toying with me.

00:50:49.192 --> 00:50:52.984
- You said it was perfect.
- It was! I don't know how she did it.

00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:54.817
She can't be alive, Alex.

00:50:54.984 --> 00:50:56.651
"I close my eyes
and you're still with me".

00:50:56.817 --> 00:50:58.942
Mayka saw your message
on my mobile.

00:50:59.734 --> 00:51:01.109
How do you know?

00:51:01.276 --> 00:51:03.317
If Mayka knows what we did,
you're in danger.

00:51:03.484 --> 00:51:05.567
She's making them think I took
her body, she's incriminating me.

00:51:05.734 --> 00:51:07.609
You were home
when she disappeared.

00:51:07.776 --> 00:51:10.234
I was alone,
my sister only arrived after 9.

00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:12.776
Mayka couldn't know all that.

00:51:12.942 --> 00:51:14.609
- Maybe she has help.
- From whom?

00:51:14.776 --> 00:51:17.442
I don't know, but her death was
certified. She can do what she likes.

00:51:17.609 --> 00:51:18.984
No one can accuse her.
Don't you see?

00:51:19.151 --> 00:51:20.817
Fuck the money.

00:51:21.317 --> 00:51:23.776
Fuck it all. Get out of there
and we'll run away.

00:51:25.692 --> 00:51:27.692
Alex, do you hear me? Alex?

00:51:27.859 --> 00:51:30.442
I have to go.
I'll call you when I can.

00:51:30.609 --> 00:51:32.401
Be careful. I love you.

00:51:39.859 --> 00:51:41.484
Let me guess.

00:51:46.776 --> 00:51:48.276
Your sister.

00:51:50.401 --> 00:51:51.942
She's worried.

00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:54.484
She thinks I should go home.

00:51:56.484 --> 00:51:57.859
Your mobile.

00:51:59.651 --> 00:52:01.151
Please.

00:52:10.817 --> 00:52:13.359
We haven't found out anything
from Ulloa's phone,

00:52:13.526 --> 00:52:14.984
no info of any use to us.

00:52:15.151 --> 00:52:17.776
He erased all incoming
and outgoing calls.

00:52:17.942 --> 00:52:20.526
I spoke to the company too,
but no luck.

00:52:20.692 --> 00:52:22.692
He's calling an unlisted number.

00:52:22.859 --> 00:52:24.859
It's impossible to know who it is.

00:52:25.026 --> 00:52:26.359
Any news on Norma?

00:52:27.567 --> 00:52:28.609
She just got back.

00:52:29.276 --> 00:52:30.859
The woods are a mess,

00:52:31.192 --> 00:52:35.526
but a team's covering the perimeter
with sniffer dogs.

00:52:35.692 --> 00:52:38.276
They'll set out
when the storm's over.

00:52:38.984 --> 00:52:41.151
Someone set off the fire alarm.

00:52:41.734 --> 00:52:44.484
Maybe by starting a fire
with a butt we found

00:52:44.651 --> 00:52:47.192
in the bathroom,
near the sensors.

00:52:49.817 --> 00:52:53.234
It must be his, I smelt smoke
when I went to get him.

00:52:53.984 --> 00:52:57.401
The water flooded the area.
The scientists are going nuts.

00:52:57.567 --> 00:52:59.359
It's impossible to trace anything.

00:52:59.526 --> 00:53:01.026
Son of a bitch.

00:53:01.526 --> 00:53:02.984
That's not all.

00:53:05.067 --> 00:53:07.567
The report on TH-16 arrived.

00:53:08.734 --> 00:53:12.692
It's a cardio-toxin,
very rarely used in medicines.

00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:15.817
It's extracted from the fluids
of certain reptiles.

00:53:16.442 --> 00:53:18.276
Diluted in blood,

00:53:18.442 --> 00:53:22.942
it causes a cardiac 8 hours
after ingestion and leaves no trace.

00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:27.192
We need a transfer car.
I'm taking him to the station.

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:29.026
I'll get right on it.

00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:35.317
Put him in a locked room,
with constant surveillance.

00:53:35.901 --> 00:53:36.567
Alright.

00:53:36.734 --> 00:53:38.817
I'm going for a smoke,
I'll be right back.

00:53:39.817 --> 00:53:41.234
And this guy...

00:53:42.692 --> 00:53:44.901
- Take his cigarettes away.
- Okay.

00:54:00.776 --> 00:54:02.151
Did you lock it?

00:54:02.317 --> 00:54:05.442
Yes. There's just that door,
but I'm not going in there.

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:07.234
And he can't get out.

00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:06.984
Tonight you will be mine.

00:57:16.317 --> 00:57:17.651
Mayka?

00:57:21.484 --> 00:57:22.692
Mayka?

00:58:23.692 --> 00:58:24.651
Mayka?

00:58:24.817 --> 00:58:26.192
Is that you?

00:58:26.442 --> 00:58:27.942
Who's this?

00:58:28.192 --> 00:58:29.442
Who am I talking to?

00:58:30.609 --> 00:58:32.526
Patricia, at Arabesco.

00:58:32.692 --> 00:58:35.401
And no, Mayka's not here.
She forgot her phone...

00:58:35.567 --> 00:58:36.942
and I'm busy.

00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:40.192
- Wait, don't hang up!
- I'm fed up with this,

00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:44.276
so unless you can tell Mayka
to contact us...

00:58:44.484 --> 00:58:47.109
Listen, you have to tell me
how you got this phone.

00:58:47.526 --> 00:58:50.442
Mayka was my wife
She died this afternoon.

00:58:50.609 --> 00:58:52.942
The last time I saw her,
she had her phone.

00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:54.359
Excuse me?

00:58:54.526 --> 00:58:57.442
My wife's dead
and you have her phone

00:58:57.609 --> 00:58:59.567
The phone was left behind tonight.

00:58:59.734 --> 00:59:01.526
I need to know who left it.
What did they look like?

00:59:01.692 --> 00:59:03.942
I don't know,
it was left in the bathroom.

00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:06.276
How do you know
it's my wife's phone?

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:08.526
She got calls!

00:59:08.692 --> 00:59:11.234
Look at her contacts
and tell me the numbers.

00:59:14.359 --> 00:59:15.859
It's empty.

00:59:16.026 --> 00:59:17.359
Look..

00:59:17.776 --> 00:59:20.234
Sorry about your wife,

00:59:20.401 --> 00:59:22.651
but I can't help you, it's late

00:59:22.817 --> 00:59:24.484
and I'm tired

00:59:24.984 --> 00:59:27.109
Listen... Patricia.

00:59:27.901 --> 00:59:30.276
My wife and I came there a lot.

00:59:30.442 --> 00:59:33.692
If I describe her, you can tell me
if she or someone linked to her

00:59:33.859 --> 00:59:36.401
left the phone.

00:59:36.859 --> 00:59:38.901
You just said your wife was dead.

00:59:39.567 --> 00:59:40.692
I know, but...

00:59:41.276 --> 00:59:43.609
Don't lie to me.
Don't drag me into your problems.

00:59:43.776 --> 00:59:44.776
I'm not lying.

00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:49.651
My wife may be alive.
It's complicated.

00:59:51.026 --> 00:59:52.942
See if the screen says "redirect".

00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:57.109
Yes, it does.

00:59:58.067 --> 00:59:59.151
Hey.

00:59:59.359 --> 01:00:00.442
Hello?

01:00:04.317 --> 01:00:05.817
Dickhead.

01:00:08.234 --> 01:00:09.526
Arabesco...

01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:16.859
Ready?

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:19.192
Are you going to tell me
what we're celebrating?

01:00:19.567 --> 01:00:22.901
I got an agreement
to sign the takeover.

01:00:23.692 --> 01:00:26.026
In a couple of weeks
I'm going to L.A.

01:00:26.192 --> 01:00:28.234
- You did it.
- Yes!

01:00:36.192 --> 01:00:38.067
Why don't you come with me?

01:00:38.359 --> 01:00:41.067
We could escape to Santa Catalina.

01:00:42.234 --> 01:00:44.484
We can book a room in Avalon.

01:00:44.984 --> 01:00:47.067
We're about to test a new patent.

01:01:00.442 --> 01:01:02.026
Excuse me a moment.

01:01:26.276 --> 01:01:28.359
An appetizer while you're waiting?

01:01:28.526 --> 01:01:30.276
No, thanks, I'm fine.

01:01:30.442 --> 01:01:32.734
I'll be back shortly
to take your order.

01:01:49.651 --> 01:01:50.526
Who's that?

01:01:53.734 --> 01:01:54.776
Nobody.

01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:56.901
Were you talking about me?

01:01:58.942 --> 01:02:00.359
You won't like it.

01:02:03.442 --> 01:02:05.109
He's my new lawyer.

01:02:05.317 --> 01:02:06.734
What's wrong with Gloria?

01:02:06.901 --> 01:02:10.026
As well as being my sister,
she's also your lawyer,

01:02:10.692 --> 01:02:14.609
and I want to revise
our marriage contract.

01:02:18.484 --> 01:02:20.484
The property division.

01:02:22.359 --> 01:02:23.942
You can't be serious.

01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:26.359
I'm always serious with you.

01:02:27.484 --> 01:02:29.442
Even if I laugh at you constantly.

01:02:30.609 --> 01:02:32.734
You want everyone
at your feet, don't you?

01:02:33.942 --> 01:02:35.692
Not everyone.

01:02:36.442 --> 01:02:38.109
You, yes.

01:02:43.734 --> 01:02:45.026
Got you!

01:02:47.276 --> 01:02:48.901
You handed that to me
on a platter!

01:02:49.067 --> 01:02:50.609
It's not funny.

01:02:53.859 --> 01:02:55.609
If he's not your lawyer,
who is he?

01:02:57.776 --> 01:02:59.442
My psychoanalyst.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.984
I didn't know
you saw a psychoanalyst.

01:03:02.151 --> 01:03:03.442
There are...

01:03:04.359 --> 01:03:06.734
lots of things
you don't know about me.

01:03:12.651 --> 01:03:16.317
You really can't come?
You won't reconsider the trip?

01:03:52.234 --> 01:03:54.192
- Yes?
- Carla, it's me

01:03:54.359 --> 01:03:56.067
Where are you calling from?

01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:57.484
The police have my mobile.

01:03:57.651 --> 01:04:00.942
They locked me in a room with
another phone, but it's no accident.

01:04:04.151 --> 01:04:06.317
- What was that?
- I just got home.

01:04:06.859 --> 01:04:09.734
I'll wait here until you get out,
then we'll run away.

01:04:10.734 --> 01:04:12.317
What's no accident?

01:04:12.484 --> 01:04:15.984
The contact list
has only one number: Mayka's.

01:04:16.692 --> 01:04:18.526
But her phone's still missing.

01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:20.776
Who does the phone belong to?

01:04:20.942 --> 01:04:23.776
Javier Alonso. I don't know
who he is, but a few weeks ago

01:04:23.942 --> 01:04:26.901
Mayka saw a man in the restaurant
I just phoned called Arabesco.

01:04:27.067 --> 01:04:29.067
I don't get it.

01:04:29.442 --> 01:04:31.526
Mayka's number
in this mobile's contact list

01:04:31.692 --> 01:04:33.442
is calling a phone left in Arabesco.

01:04:33.609 --> 01:04:36.359
- Another forgotten mobile?
- Never mind.

01:04:37.192 --> 01:04:39.817
Mayka said that man
was her psychoanalyst,

01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:42.234
but she was lying.

01:04:42.526 --> 01:04:45.026
Now she wants me
to make the link with her,

01:04:45.192 --> 01:04:48.234
Arabesco, the forgotten phone
and that man.

01:04:48.609 --> 01:04:50.567
I think he's Javier Alonso.

01:04:51.192 --> 01:04:53.109
But I don't know how he fits in.

01:04:53.276 --> 01:04:57.151
You have to help me.
His details are on your screen.

01:04:57.317 --> 01:05:00.192
When we find out who Alonso is,
we'll discover Mayka's game.

01:05:00.942 --> 01:05:04.067
Where'd you get that phone?

01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:10.609
I'm looking at the corpse
of Javier Alonso.

01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:12.567
The mobile was in his body bag.

01:05:13.026 --> 01:05:15.317
Help me find out
who Javier Alonso was

01:05:15.484 --> 01:05:17.317
and we'll get out of this.

01:05:17.484 --> 01:05:18.984
I'll tell you something.

01:05:47.817 --> 01:05:49.317
Where's Eva?

01:05:51.276 --> 01:05:53.067
Under observation.

01:05:53.692 --> 01:05:55.817
You'd better go back to her.

01:05:57.776 --> 01:05:59.359
I'm going in.

01:06:37.192 --> 01:06:39.776
She's so pretty Go to Mummy.

01:06:41.484 --> 01:06:43.609
Oh, my girl. Hello, Eva.

01:06:43.901 --> 01:06:45.276
Blow, sweetie.

01:06:49.401 --> 01:06:51.359
Look, Daddy, look at me do it.

01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:53.609
Okay, honey, be careful

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:02.984
I'll talk to Peña
and then let you know.

01:08:05.067 --> 01:08:07.734
The papers from Gloria Villaverde.

01:08:09.359 --> 01:08:10.901
The last page.

01:08:14.067 --> 01:08:17.317
As well as being her lawyer,
she also did the accounting.

01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:21.234
We checked details on this invoice,
but we haven't found him yet.

01:08:21.401 --> 01:08:23.901
He's not answering
his home phone or his mobile.

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:26.609
His office is in his home.
I'll go there with a team.

01:08:26.776 --> 01:08:28.109
We're leaving now.

01:08:36.067 --> 01:08:37.651
Am I under arrest?

01:08:37.901 --> 01:08:40.692
I can hold you
until your wife's body turns up.

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:42.192
I demand an explanation.

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:46.234
I think you killed your wife
with the TH-16

01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:49.442
and stole her body
so there'd be no autopsy.

01:08:51.442 --> 01:08:54.151
On what do you base
this fabrication?

01:08:54.317 --> 01:08:56.984
Your behaviour,
the vial hidden in your pocket...

01:08:57.151 --> 01:08:59.984
- It's not mine.
- They make it in your lab.

01:09:00.567 --> 01:09:02.859
It can cause cardiac arrest.

01:09:03.026 --> 01:09:04.109
You're a chemist,

01:09:04.276 --> 01:09:07.109
your wife died of cardiac arrest.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:08.942
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:11.317
I didn't poison my wife.

01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:14.942
If I did, I wouldn't come here
with a vial of the toxin.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.817
It's absurd to poison someone
with TH-16,

01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:19.734
then steal the body.

01:09:19.901 --> 01:09:22.192
It's undetectable
in a routine autopsy.

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:25.401
It wasn't your specialty before,
now you're an expert.

01:09:25.567 --> 01:09:27.192
I was nervous before.

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:30.901
If you want a confession
to close the case, forget it.

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:33.151
You've got nothing on me.

01:09:33.567 --> 01:09:36.859
I just need to show that something
went wrong so you took the body!

01:09:37.026 --> 01:09:40.692
You need to find Mayka,
and I can't help you with that.

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:42.567
I've no idea where she is.

01:09:49.567 --> 01:09:51.151
How did you meet your wife?

01:09:51.776 --> 01:09:55.401
- What does that matter?
- Curiosity. Too many differences.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.692
- Differences?
- In age...

01:09:57.942 --> 01:10:00.484
...status, everything.

01:10:03.609 --> 01:10:04.859
Answer me.

01:10:06.401 --> 01:10:09.317
It was in Avalon,

01:10:09.484 --> 01:10:11.776
on Santa Catalina Island,
near L.A.

01:10:12.192 --> 01:10:15.151
I spent some days there
after my first year in the university.

01:10:15.317 --> 01:10:16.734
You taught Chemistry.

01:10:16.901 --> 01:10:20.192
Yes. I didn't like it.
I took a trip to think it over.

01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:24.859
One morning, going up
a mountain, a tyre blew out.

01:10:25.109 --> 01:10:27.734
Mayka was the only person
I saw in three hours.

01:10:27.901 --> 01:10:30.026
She gave me water, her mobile...

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:32.026
and I changed the tyre.

01:10:32.192 --> 01:10:35.442
- Lost on an island...
- We were at the same hotel.

01:10:36.151 --> 01:10:38.776
She'd just lost her parents
and felt lost, like I did.

01:10:38.942 --> 01:10:42.526
Lost but a millionaire.
She'd just inherited a fortune.

01:10:43.692 --> 01:10:47.151
- We fell in love.
- How nice, like in the movies.

01:10:47.317 --> 01:10:50.567
It's what happened.
I was lucky.

01:10:52.026 --> 01:10:53.776
Luck's something you have...

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:55.942
or you seek it out.

01:10:56.109 --> 01:10:57.734
What do you think?

01:10:59.776 --> 01:11:01.817
What the hell
do you want from me?

01:11:11.109 --> 01:11:14.359
Let's go back to when
you found your wife's body.

01:11:14.526 --> 01:11:17.109
I told the police
who came to my house.

01:11:17.276 --> 01:11:19.067
I want you to tell me.

01:11:23.234 --> 01:11:27.651
I came home and Mayka
was lying on the sofa, dead.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.651
I thought she was asleep,

01:11:30.942 --> 01:11:33.734
but it was strange
that she had her shoes on.

01:11:33.901 --> 01:11:37.526
I took her pulse, called an ambulance,
and they called the police.

01:11:37.692 --> 01:11:40.317
- And the last time you saw her alive?
- That morning.

01:11:40.484 --> 01:11:43.901
Three weeks apart.
She arrives and you leave.

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:46.942
What are you insinuating?
I loved my wife.

01:11:47.109 --> 01:11:50.692
- You loved her?
- I loved her to the last moment.

01:11:52.192 --> 01:11:55.442
Don't you still love someone
after they're dead?

01:12:01.026 --> 01:12:05.026
Your calm at her unexpected death
surprises me, it's unnerving.

01:12:06.442 --> 01:12:09.984
I'm a scientist,
I know we're not machines.

01:12:10.276 --> 01:12:12.859
I heard the forensic person:
A fear of flying can...

01:12:13.026 --> 01:12:16.109
A handy theory for you, eh?
I'm sure you already knew.

01:12:16.609 --> 01:12:20.609
I had a heart scare two years ago,
with no previous signs.

01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:24.276
These things come without warning.

01:12:24.442 --> 01:12:27.692
What did you do after
your wife's body was taken away?

01:12:30.359 --> 01:12:32.442
I made some calls, I cried...

01:12:32.942 --> 01:12:35.901
Gloria, Luna and my sister came over,
we reminisced about Mayka.

01:12:36.192 --> 01:12:37.526
And later?

01:12:37.692 --> 01:12:41.192
Gloria, Luna
and your sister went home.

01:12:41.526 --> 01:12:44.442
- What did you do then?
- Nothing.

01:12:44.609 --> 01:12:46.776
We sent a patrol car for you.
You weren't at home.

01:12:47.401 --> 01:12:49.484
I went out for painkillers.
I told you.

01:12:49.651 --> 01:12:51.942
- Painkillers...
- Yes. I had a headache.

01:12:52.609 --> 01:12:55.359
You came straight here
after our call.

01:12:55.859 --> 01:12:57.151
Exactly.

01:12:57.317 --> 01:13:00.484
So you have the painkillers.
Show them to me.

01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:07.776
This is absurd.

01:13:07.942 --> 01:13:09.401
Convince me.

01:13:14.609 --> 01:13:16.526
Now you're ringing true.

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:20.692
And as a reward, I'll give you
proof of my theory.

01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:25.692
Proof you say I don't have.

01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:34.609
Your wife hired a detective
three months ago.

01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:37.401
He's been following you, Mr. Ulloa.

01:13:38.234 --> 01:13:39.984
We have the invoice.

01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:44.067
And also your marriage contract.

01:13:47.276 --> 01:13:50.359
I think your wife suspected you
of cheating on her.

01:13:50.942 --> 01:13:51.942
If so,

01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:56.359
you would've violated
one of the main clauses,

01:13:56.859 --> 01:14:01.359
and you'd lose all rights
if your wife divorced you.

01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:05.026
The question is:
Did the detective catch you?

01:14:07.567 --> 01:14:10.192
I think you know
the answer to that,

01:14:10.859 --> 01:14:14.026
and you killed her before
she cut you off with nothing.

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.151
We'll soon know for sure.

01:14:16.401 --> 01:14:19.692
A patrol car is heading for
the home of Javier Alonso.

01:14:23.484 --> 01:14:24.901
Javier Alonso?

01:14:25.276 --> 01:14:27.151
Your wife's detective.

01:14:32.817 --> 01:14:35.401
Anything true you'd like to add?

01:14:44.609 --> 01:14:45.942
Look at the name.

01:14:52.359 --> 01:14:53.651
Diego Aguilar.

01:15:00.817 --> 01:15:02.067
What are you doing?

01:15:32.817 --> 01:15:33.901
Go ahead, Pablo.

01:15:34.067 --> 01:15:36.942
We're in Alonso's office
and there's no trace of him

01:15:37.109 --> 01:15:40.067
or any of the cases
he was investigating.

01:15:40.234 --> 01:15:42.567
Someone's taken his hard disk

01:15:42.817 --> 01:15:44.859
Register of last calls?
Messages?

01:15:45.026 --> 01:15:46.484
There's nothing here, Jaime.

01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:47.817
Go to Ulloa's house.

01:15:48.151 --> 01:15:51.901
- I'll call the judge for a warrant.
- Okay.

01:15:52.359 --> 01:15:54.067
Where's the transfer car?

01:15:56.942 --> 01:15:58.526
Norma here. Do you read me?

01:15:59.151 --> 01:16:00.317
I read you. Go ahead.

01:16:00.484 --> 01:16:03.067
Central said you were coming
What's the delay?

01:16:03.234 --> 01:16:05.942
The road's cut off.

01:16:06.109 --> 01:16:08.984
The storm tore down some power lines.

01:16:09.192 --> 01:16:12.192
They don't know how long
it'll take to shift them.

01:16:27.442 --> 01:16:28.776
Any news?

01:16:28.942 --> 01:16:33.026
Yeah, babe. I'm knackered.
Want me to get you a coffee?

01:17:13.192 --> 01:17:15.526
- Alex, is that you?
- Javier Alonso is a detective.

01:17:16.192 --> 01:17:17.401
I know.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:20.192
- You found him?
- Not exactly

01:17:20.359 --> 01:17:24.026
Someone put an envelope under my door
while I was at the hospital.

01:17:27.026 --> 01:17:29.067
There was a pendrive in it.

01:17:29.234 --> 01:17:32.026
- Is it from Javier Alonso?
- No sender.

01:17:32.192 --> 01:17:36.276
It has a file in his name.
I'm sending you the photos.

01:17:46.067 --> 01:17:47.234
Alex?

01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:50.776
Alex!

01:17:51.442 --> 01:17:52.526
Yes...

01:17:52.817 --> 01:17:56.609
That's not all.
They put a mike on you. Listen.

01:17:56.776 --> 01:17:58.609
I've got everything.

01:17:58.776 --> 01:18:01.401
Mayka's going to L.A. soon.
It'll be when she comes back.

01:18:01.567 --> 01:18:04.442
She hates flying.
It'll explain the heart attack.

01:18:06.817 --> 01:18:08.567
Mayka knew everything.

01:18:09.401 --> 01:18:11.401
She sent it.
She'll be coming for you.

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:14.151
- You have to leave! Now!
- I am.

01:18:14.317 --> 01:18:15.484
We'll be together soon.

01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:17.901
You've been saying that all night
and you're still there.

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:20.651
The main thing now
is to get you safe.

01:18:20.817 --> 01:18:23.359
- And you?
- I'm fine.

01:18:23.859 --> 01:18:26.359
How can you be fine?
Alex, they won't let you go!

01:18:26.901 --> 01:18:28.734
Of course they will.

01:18:28.901 --> 01:18:32.067
- They'll make you confess!
- Listen to me, listen.

01:18:33.151 --> 01:18:35.942
If Mayka's still alive,
they can't accuse us of anything.

01:18:36.109 --> 01:18:38.442
She knows it and wants us
to pay in her own way.

01:18:38.609 --> 01:18:40.109
She can do what she wants.

01:18:40.276 --> 01:18:42.609
She's certified as dead,
she's free of any blame

01:18:42.776 --> 01:18:45.151
But I promise, nothing bad
will happen to you, okay?

01:18:45.317 --> 01:18:47.026
I can't take this anymore.

01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:50.234
You and I should never have met.

01:18:51.401 --> 01:18:52.734
Carla, I love you.

01:18:52.901 --> 01:18:55.817
- And I love you, but...
- Then trust me, please

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.109
What was that?

01:19:00.901 --> 01:19:02.859
The lift is stuck.

01:19:03.192 --> 01:19:04.526
Are you trapped?

01:19:04.859 --> 01:19:06.817
Fuck. It's stuck!

01:19:06.984 --> 01:19:08.442
Push the alarm.

01:19:09.401 --> 01:19:10.609
What's happening now?

01:19:11.484 --> 01:19:13.026
It's moving.

01:19:13.901 --> 01:19:15.359
But are you alright?

01:19:16.526 --> 01:19:17.692
I don't know.

01:19:18.609 --> 01:19:22.942
I get the feeling someone's here,
that I'm not alone.

01:19:27.734 --> 01:19:28.859
Carla, are you alright?

01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:32.526
Do anything to get out of there
and join me.

01:19:32.692 --> 01:19:34.026
I promise.

01:19:34.192 --> 01:19:36.442
We'll soon be together.
It'll all be fine.

01:19:36.609 --> 01:19:39.526
Don't abandon me.
Don't worry Where will I find you?

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:43.317
- In the car.
- Good, go for a drive.

01:19:43.484 --> 01:19:45.692
Don't stop, that'll be safest.

01:19:47.609 --> 01:19:48.692
Carla?

01:19:52.359 --> 01:19:53.526
Carla?

01:19:55.317 --> 01:19:56.734
Carla!

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.317
What's he doing?

01:20:19.317 --> 01:20:21.151
- Where the hell are you going?
- I've got to go.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.442
I give the orders here
and you're in my custody.

01:20:23.609 --> 01:20:25.109
Someone needs my help.

01:20:25.276 --> 01:20:26.567
- Your help?
- Yes.

01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:27.942
Who?

01:20:28.442 --> 01:20:31.984
Who the hell do you think you are?
You think you can hold me?

01:20:32.151 --> 01:20:35.067
You've got no fucking idea
of what I'm capable of!

01:20:35.984 --> 01:20:37.651
Piss off!

01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:47.817
Alright.

01:20:49.151 --> 01:20:50.984
Yes, that's the address.

01:20:55.192 --> 01:20:56.859
Call me if there's any news.

01:20:59.567 --> 01:21:03.442
A patrol car is heading for
the address you gave us.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:06.859
Now tell me everything again,

01:21:07.734 --> 01:21:09.234
from the beginning.

01:21:21.192 --> 01:21:23.901
Her name's Carla, Carla Miller.

01:21:24.484 --> 01:21:25.734
I met her 8 months ago.

01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:27.859
Class B, transposition...

01:21:28.026 --> 01:21:30.401
I was giving a talk
at the university.

01:21:30.567 --> 01:21:33.484
I'd been arguing with Mayka
and I couldn't concentrate

01:21:33.651 --> 01:21:37.192
I kept losing the thread
I was about to stop the class

01:21:37.401 --> 01:21:40.734
when she arrived,
twenty minutes late.

01:21:41.692 --> 01:21:43.026
Excuse me.

01:21:44.151 --> 01:21:45.401
Come in, come in.

01:21:51.567 --> 01:21:53.067
In this process,

01:21:54.317 --> 01:21:56.192
the proteins

01:21:56.359 --> 01:21:59.151
can behave as co-factors...

01:22:00.359 --> 01:22:02.442
...in an approximate percentage..

01:22:02.609 --> 01:22:04.984
She came up and asked me
if she'd missed anything.

01:22:05.151 --> 01:22:07.151
I said yes. I lied to her.

01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:10.859
She snared me straight away

01:22:12.609 --> 01:22:16.984
She'd started Medicine.
She was struggling with Chemistry.

01:22:17.151 --> 01:22:19.026
I offered to help her.

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:22.442
It was all very easy.
It seemed natural to me.

01:22:22.609 --> 01:22:26.276
At first we worked,
but the classes became an excuse

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:29.026
and we began seeing each other
every day.

01:22:30.484 --> 01:22:33.984
I wanted to be honest,
and told her I was married.

01:22:34.151 --> 01:22:37.067
She had a boyfriend,
so it was all fine

01:22:39.442 --> 01:22:40.609
What are you doing here?

01:22:40.776 --> 01:22:44.192
It was a harmless game.
We didn't do anything, just talked.

01:22:45.192 --> 01:22:47.442
But we spent so much time together

01:22:48.234 --> 01:22:49.526
that Mayka began to suspect.

01:22:49.692 --> 01:22:51.401
I expected you earlier.

01:22:52.026 --> 01:22:53.692
I tried to stop seeing her.

01:22:53.859 --> 01:22:57.109
But it was impossible,
all I could think of was her.

01:22:57.359 --> 01:23:00.859
In the end,
the inevitable happened.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.442
With Carla I felt alive again.

01:23:54.526 --> 01:23:57.942
That night,
I told her my life story,

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:00.651
things I'd never told anyone.

01:24:00.817 --> 01:24:02.817
Neither of us wanted secrets.

01:24:04.276 --> 01:24:05.692
But there was my wife..

01:24:06.942 --> 01:24:08.984
She said she didn't want
to deceive anyone.

01:24:09.151 --> 01:24:12.734
I didn't want to deceive my wife,
but I was in love with Carla.

01:24:12.901 --> 01:24:14.901
She left her boyfriend for me

01:24:15.901 --> 01:24:19.442
But I wasn't ready
to tell Mayka the truth

01:24:19.651 --> 01:24:21.401
And Carla got tired of waiting

01:24:21.567 --> 01:24:23.317
She refused to see me anymore.

01:24:23.692 --> 01:24:25.484
And she vanished from the map.

01:24:25.942 --> 01:24:27.359
I went crazy.

01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:29.942
I couldn't live without her.
I had to do something.

01:24:30.567 --> 01:24:32.984
There was no going back.
I was in love

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.151
And I decided. I went to see her

01:24:36.276 --> 01:24:40.359
I told her it was over with Mayka,
I'd leave her to be with her.

01:24:41.651 --> 01:24:43.651
I love you.

01:24:45.734 --> 01:24:47.401
But it wasn't that easy.

01:24:47.942 --> 01:24:50.317
Mayka was stalking me,
watching me

01:24:50.484 --> 01:24:53.817
I knew a divorce would mean war,
and she'd win.

01:24:54.651 --> 01:24:56.567
She'd destroy me.
She'd leave me with nothing.

01:24:56.734 --> 01:24:59.401
She'd make me start from nothing
to show she was still in control.

01:24:59.567 --> 01:25:02.026
You say you want to be with me,
but you don't want a divorce.

01:25:02.192 --> 01:25:04.817
I don't want to be with you
while you're with her.

01:25:04.984 --> 01:25:06.484
I can't take any more.

01:25:06.942 --> 01:25:10.359
This is over,
I can't take any more.

01:25:23.234 --> 01:25:26.484
I can stop being with her
without getting a divorce.

01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:28.817
We can have it all.

01:25:29.942 --> 01:25:32.234
She could have an accident.

01:25:33.317 --> 01:25:35.651
I need to know if Carla's alright.

01:25:36.776 --> 01:25:38.567
There's something I don't get.

01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:43.442
If you carefully planned
your wife's death,

01:25:43.692 --> 01:25:46.567
sure of the toxin's infallibility,

01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:48.442
why would she be alive?

01:25:50.317 --> 01:25:51.151
I saw you.

01:25:51.317 --> 01:25:53.442
Your wife hired a detective
three months ago.

01:25:53.609 --> 01:25:55.192
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me

01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:56.859
Mayka's going to L.A. soon.

01:25:57.026 --> 01:25:59.359
Her fear of flying
can explain a heart attack.

01:25:59.526 --> 01:26:02.609
Someone put an envelope under
my door while I was at the hospital.

01:26:02.776 --> 01:26:03.942
Mayka knew everything

01:26:04.234 --> 01:26:07.984
How did she avoid dying?
You saw her drink the wine.

01:26:11.567 --> 01:26:13.276
She could've switched glasses.

01:26:19.151 --> 01:26:22.817
If she did,
what do you think happened next?

01:26:22.984 --> 01:26:27.234
She could've taken a neuroleptic
to enter a state of catalepsy.

01:26:27.942 --> 01:26:30.901
Some can be diluted in the blood,

01:26:31.067 --> 01:26:33.609
slow down the lungs
and virtually stop the heart.

01:26:35.026 --> 01:26:37.984
Once the agent metabolizes
in the organism,

01:26:38.484 --> 01:26:40.234
the body returns to normal.

01:26:40.401 --> 01:26:42.859
A little twisted. And dangerous.

01:26:43.026 --> 01:26:44.776
Not for Mayka.

01:26:47.067 --> 01:26:48.651
She likes to play.

01:26:49.651 --> 01:26:51.692
And she hates to lose.

01:26:53.234 --> 01:26:55.901
Listen, I've told you everything.

01:26:56.484 --> 01:26:59.401
Please, ask after Carla.

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:03.817
Jaime.

01:27:07.067 --> 01:27:08.526
I'll be right back.

01:27:08.942 --> 01:27:11.651
- Who is it?
- Pablo, from Ulloa's house.

01:27:14.484 --> 01:27:15.276
Go ahead.

01:27:15.442 --> 01:27:18.276
We found plans of the morgue.
There's a route mapped out

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:22.026
and instructions on how to
manipulate the security system.

01:27:22.359 --> 01:27:24.192
We're taking all the papers.

01:27:24.359 --> 01:27:26.901
- He knew the building backwards.
- Any trace of the body?

01:27:27.067 --> 01:27:27.984
No, but we found

01:27:28.151 --> 01:27:30.734
a shovel and a sports bag
in the boot of Ulloa's car.

01:27:30.901 --> 01:27:33.067
In it were a balaclava
and some trainers

01:27:33.234 --> 01:27:37.067
that match the footprints
on the morgue's emergency stairs.

01:27:37.484 --> 01:27:38.317
Anything else?

01:27:38.484 --> 01:27:42.192
We also found
a '32 hidden in a box.

01:27:42.359 --> 01:27:46.067
It's unregistered
and has been fired recently.

01:27:46.692 --> 01:27:48.317
What the hell's going on?

01:27:49.609 --> 01:27:50.859
I've got another call.

01:27:53.317 --> 01:27:54.151
What is it?

01:27:54.401 --> 01:27:56.276
Ángel Torres is awake.

01:27:56.526 --> 01:27:58.359
- Hold on.
- Okay.

01:28:01.567 --> 01:28:03.317
The guard is conscious.

01:28:03.984 --> 01:28:07.234
I'll pass you to the hospital.
We're heading for the woods.

01:28:08.067 --> 01:28:09.359
- Jaime
- How is he?

01:28:09.526 --> 01:28:11.942
Disoriented, but I spoke to him.

01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:14.734
- What did he say?
- You're not gonna believe it.

01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:15.984
Fire away.

01:29:55.567 --> 01:29:56.984
Hello?

01:30:13.067 --> 01:30:16.776
Yes. This is Ángel Torres.
I'm calling from the morgue.

01:30:16.942 --> 01:30:19.817
I think...
I need you to come here.

01:30:20.192 --> 01:30:23.359
Yes, I'll wait. Hurry up.

01:30:46.067 --> 01:30:48.859
He ran out of the morgue
like a scared rat

01:30:49.026 --> 01:30:50.651
until he was run over

01:30:51.692 --> 01:30:54.442
We just found them.
They're from a '32,

01:30:55.192 --> 01:30:56.526
like the gun at your house.

01:30:56.859 --> 01:30:59.192
I don't own a gun.
It was Mayka.

01:30:59.484 --> 01:31:01.484
Your wife's dead, Mr. Ulloa. Dead.

01:31:01.651 --> 01:31:04.984
You can't prove it. They haven't
found the body, nor will they.

01:31:05.151 --> 01:31:07.526
- Because you took it!
- I didn't do anything.

01:31:07.692 --> 01:31:10.317
You motherfucker!
You killed her, then took her away.

01:31:10.484 --> 01:31:12.692
Mayka wants you to think that.
Can't you see?

01:31:13.776 --> 01:31:16.484
Mayka's behind it all.
She set it up with someone's help.

01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:19.526
She faked her disappearance
and made sure she'd wake up.

01:31:27.317 --> 01:31:29.401
She's fucking alive!
She's alive!

01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:31.567
No! You took her body!

01:31:31.734 --> 01:31:34.151
The plans to the morgue
were hidden in your house.

01:31:34.317 --> 01:31:35.567
You had it all worked out.

01:31:35.734 --> 01:31:38.151
You distracted the guard
to confuse us

01:31:38.317 --> 01:31:42.276
You knew he'd confuse us,
but then he got run over,

01:31:42.442 --> 01:31:45.609
so you've been winging it all night,
playing with us!

01:31:45.776 --> 01:31:47.651
What does it matter now?

01:31:49.567 --> 01:31:52.651
It was set up so that
Mayka would be declared dead,

01:31:52.817 --> 01:31:53.942
and I'd confess.

01:31:58.609 --> 01:32:02.442
Nothing that happened tonight
was an accident,

01:32:02.609 --> 01:32:04.026
believe me.

01:32:04.442 --> 01:32:08.692
Mayka has the power and money
to vanish without a trace

01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:13.317
It's perfect.
She left no loose ends.

01:32:15.901 --> 01:32:19.776
If it's not too late,
Carla will corroborate my story.

01:32:19.942 --> 01:32:23.234
How do you keep justifying
the unjustifiable?

01:32:23.484 --> 01:32:26.317
Don't you get tired?
Aren't you disgusted?

01:32:27.859 --> 01:32:29.234
Please...

01:32:30.692 --> 01:32:32.609
I need you to help Carla.

01:32:33.984 --> 01:32:35.276
Please.

01:33:21.526 --> 01:33:23.109
Any news on Carla Miller?

01:33:23.276 --> 01:33:24.276
There's no one here.

01:33:24.442 --> 01:33:25.901
- Any signs of violence?
- No.

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:28.526
The suspect claims
the girl was warned.

01:33:28.692 --> 01:33:30.442
Could she have run away?

01:33:30.609 --> 01:33:34.567
If she hasn't,
someone's made it look that way.

01:33:36.567 --> 01:33:38.609
I'll call you if there's any news.

01:33:44.484 --> 01:33:46.317
Tow truck to the coordinates.
Copy that.

01:33:46.484 --> 01:33:48.442
I don't know what we'll find there.

01:33:48.609 --> 01:33:50.651
I'll await instructions
and tell HQ.

01:33:50.817 --> 01:33:53.526
The tow truck will be 15 minutes.
Everything else in order?

01:33:53.692 --> 01:33:56.859
- Yes, but I need the traffic diverted.
- I'll tell them.

01:33:59.484 --> 01:34:02.526
Jaime's here now. When I speak
to him, I'll relay the info.

01:34:04.276 --> 01:34:06.192
We've found a body.

01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:08.526
Tell Norma and Mateos.

01:35:38.734 --> 01:35:42.484
No one lives at the address
you gave us for Carla Miller.

01:35:43.442 --> 01:35:45.776
The flat's been vacant for years.

01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:50.192
And the neighbours can't recall
any Carla Miller.

01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:54.234
We also checked
Sacred Heart Hospital

01:35:54.859 --> 01:35:56.692
and the Faculty of Medicine,

01:35:57.317 --> 01:35:59.609
but the person you describe...

01:36:00.942 --> 01:36:02.776
does not exist.

01:36:07.526 --> 01:36:09.109
Do you know what I think?

01:36:10.859 --> 01:36:12.526
You invented her

01:36:12.692 --> 01:36:14.776
because you're weak and a coward.

01:36:15.442 --> 01:36:16.734
You invented her.

01:36:17.359 --> 01:36:21.359
Carla Miller gave you the courage
to kill your wife and keep her money.

01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:30.526
Get Forensics to take away the body.

01:36:31.317 --> 01:36:34.651
And clear the road when you can,
this looks like a circus.

01:36:34.817 --> 01:36:36.651
Everyone, get out of here. Go!

01:36:36.817 --> 01:36:38.651
You heard. Everyone out.

01:36:39.151 --> 01:36:42.276
Call the judge.
Tell him we found the body

01:36:42.442 --> 01:36:45.526
and we can charge Ulloa
whenever he orders it.

01:36:54.317 --> 01:36:55.567
Get up.

01:36:57.526 --> 01:36:59.317
C'mon, get up. Let's go.

01:37:52.567 --> 01:37:53.984
Where are you going?

01:38:01.734 --> 01:38:03.192
I know.

01:38:04.109 --> 01:38:08.067
It's hard pretending to be
what you're not all the time.

01:38:08.234 --> 01:38:09.484
What's wrong with me?

01:38:09.651 --> 01:38:11.526
We've been at it eight hours straight,

01:38:11.692 --> 01:38:14.151
shut in a goddamn morgue.

01:38:14.317 --> 01:38:16.109
How do you expect to feel?

01:38:16.276 --> 01:38:17.984
I need help. Please.

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:19.776
Please.

01:38:24.651 --> 01:38:25.859
You know what?

01:38:28.067 --> 01:38:30.151
This reminds me of my wife.

01:38:31.817 --> 01:38:35.109
She died 10 years ago today.

01:38:40.817 --> 01:38:44.109
The official version is that
she had an accident.

01:38:44.859 --> 01:38:46.192
She was murdered.

01:39:06.067 --> 01:39:08.317
My daughter was in the car too.

01:39:13.859 --> 01:39:14.651
Are you okay?

01:39:14.817 --> 01:39:16.067
Yes.

01:39:18.484 --> 01:39:19.484
Ruth?

01:39:27.359 --> 01:39:30.567
A call to Emergencies
would've saved her life

01:39:30.734 --> 01:39:33.276
But the car that hit us drove off.

01:39:33.442 --> 01:39:37.192
I guess they were high
on some shit, or drunk.

01:39:37.526 --> 01:39:40.067
They left us there like dogs.

01:39:49.192 --> 01:39:51.484
Help! Help!

01:40:08.026 --> 01:40:10.067
She hung on for an hour

01:40:10.609 --> 01:40:12.359
Ruth, my love...

01:40:13.317 --> 01:40:16.526
But she died a few minutes
before we were found.

01:40:21.901 --> 01:40:24.401
I tried to recall the license plate.

01:40:25.526 --> 01:40:26.692
Nothing.

01:40:27.859 --> 01:40:30.567
Until, years later,
my daughter remembered.

01:40:35.192 --> 01:40:36.276
A hotel.

01:40:37.192 --> 01:40:39.067
...In Avalon...

01:40:39.442 --> 01:40:41.609
...on the Island of Santa Catalina.

01:40:42.859 --> 01:40:45.776
It was like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

01:40:46.359 --> 01:40:49.567
But I had all the time in the world,
and I found it.

01:40:57.317 --> 01:40:58.526
Drive.

01:40:59.776 --> 01:41:00.817
There's a little girl.

01:41:00.984 --> 01:41:03.192
- Did she see you?
- No.

01:41:03.901 --> 01:41:05.526
Then drive.

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:10.526
How could you live all these years
knowing you were murderers?

01:41:12.984 --> 01:41:14.651
I want you to see something.

01:41:15.484 --> 01:41:17.234
It'll help you understand.

01:41:19.401 --> 01:41:22.692
My daughter. Her name's Eva.

01:41:24.567 --> 01:41:26.901
I won't be with you
as long as you're with her.

01:41:27.067 --> 01:41:30.442
We could have it all.
She could have an accident.

01:41:31.609 --> 01:41:33.401
Why won't you answer it?

01:41:33.567 --> 01:41:34.817
- Yes?
- Mr. Ulloa?

01:41:34.984 --> 01:41:38.192
This is Jaime Peña.
I'm calling from the morgue.

01:41:38.901 --> 01:41:40.901
Your wife's body has disappeared.

01:41:41.067 --> 01:41:42.651
What do you mean "disappeared"?

01:41:43.026 --> 01:41:45.401
It has to be more personal.

01:41:45.776 --> 01:41:50.276
Someone wishing to harm your wife,
even after she was dead

01:41:50.692 --> 01:41:51.567
I'm in the car.

01:41:51.734 --> 01:41:54.942
I went out for a smoke.
The guard's still unconscious.

01:41:55.401 --> 01:41:58.984
We found a shovel and a sports bag
in the boot of Ulloa's car.

01:41:59.151 --> 01:42:02.026
In it are a balaclava
and some trainers

01:42:02.192 --> 01:42:05.442
that match the footprints
on the morgue's emergency stairs.

01:42:07.817 --> 01:42:09.817
You were ready to believe it all

01:42:13.734 --> 01:42:15.067
Especially Carla.

01:42:16.401 --> 01:42:18.734
I just came out of the restaurant.

01:42:19.026 --> 01:42:21.859
I left the mobile in the bathroom.
No one saw me.

01:42:22.026 --> 01:42:24.276
- What was that?
- The lift is stuck.

01:42:24.442 --> 01:42:26.276
We'll soon be together.

01:42:29.984 --> 01:42:30.984
Carla?

01:42:32.651 --> 01:42:33.317
Carla!

01:42:36.026 --> 01:42:38.401
Eva got to you
without my knowledge.

01:42:38.567 --> 01:42:40.859
She feared the car she recalled

01:42:41.026 --> 01:42:43.151
didn't belong
to her mother's killers,

01:42:43.317 --> 01:42:45.776
that you and your wife
were innocent.

01:42:45.942 --> 01:42:47.984
I knew it was you.

01:42:48.151 --> 01:42:51.109
But she didn't,
and she wanted to be sure.

01:42:51.276 --> 01:42:55.192
The only way to verify your guilt
was to make you talk

01:42:56.484 --> 01:42:57.984
She did it.

01:42:58.984 --> 01:43:02.317
You confessed
your darkest secret to her.

01:43:04.192 --> 01:43:06.692
Eva knew I was ready to act.

01:43:07.151 --> 01:43:10.817
She knew if she told me
you'd confessed to your crime,

01:43:11.651 --> 01:43:14.942
I'd have a green light
to go after you and your wife.

01:43:16.401 --> 01:43:17.692
And she did it

01:43:17.859 --> 01:43:19.651
We have to do it, honey.

01:43:19.817 --> 01:43:21.609
She told me everything

01:43:21.776 --> 01:43:25.026
Since then you've just been
a puppet in our hands.

01:43:26.359 --> 01:43:28.109
I know what you're thinking.

01:43:28.442 --> 01:43:30.942
Ten years leaves
a lot of time for thinking.

01:43:37.067 --> 01:43:38.776
The detective...

01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:41.942
...was a bargain.

01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:45.317
I just had to put
the invoice in the dossier

01:43:45.484 --> 01:43:47.317
Eva and I took care of the rest.

01:43:47.776 --> 01:43:50.276
They also put a mike on you.
Listen.

01:43:50.442 --> 01:43:52.692
I've got everything.
Mayka's going to L.A. soon.

01:43:52.859 --> 01:43:55.567
It'll be when she comes back.
She hates flying.

01:43:55.734 --> 01:43:57.984
It'll explain the heart attack.

01:43:59.192 --> 01:44:00.942
Mayka knew everything

01:44:01.526 --> 01:44:03.192
I'm at the airport.

01:44:03.359 --> 01:44:06.359
There's now no trace of me
you-know-where.

01:44:06.526 --> 01:44:08.234
Nobody saw me get here.

01:44:08.567 --> 01:44:10.151
I'm going back to Berlin.

01:44:10.859 --> 01:44:13.567
Javier Alonso
is conveniently on a trip

01:44:13.734 --> 01:44:15.776
And of course,
he didn't find out anything.

01:44:15.942 --> 01:44:19.359
The only thing on record
is that Mayka hired him.

01:44:19.526 --> 01:44:22.609
I have your wife's body
and your confession.

01:44:23.317 --> 01:44:26.317
Nothing alters the consequences
of our actions.

01:44:27.026 --> 01:44:30.026
Sooner or later,
someone calls in the debt.

01:44:43.817 --> 01:44:46.109
You'll soon be joining her.

01:44:47.234 --> 01:44:49.026
- What's TH-16?
- A toxin.

01:44:49.192 --> 01:44:50.026
What kind?

01:44:50.192 --> 01:44:52.151
It's extracted
from certain reptiles

01:44:52.317 --> 01:44:53.526
Why won't you answer it?

01:44:53.692 --> 01:44:54.567
Hello?

01:44:54.734 --> 01:44:56.817
Mr. Ulloa, this is
Inspector Jaime Peña

01:44:56.984 --> 01:44:58.901
I'm calling from the morgue

01:44:59.442 --> 01:45:02.567
- Your wife's body has disappeared.
- What do you mean "disappeared"?

01:45:02.734 --> 01:45:05.942
Nothing tonight
has happened by accident.

01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:08.442
- Who was it?
- The police.

01:45:09.359 --> 01:45:11.442
I had a heart scare two years ago,

01:45:11.609 --> 01:45:12.484
and I was fine.

01:45:12.651 --> 01:45:16.609
We've been at it 8 hours straight,
shut in a goddamn morgue.

01:45:16.776 --> 01:45:18.026
How do you expect to feel?

01:45:18.192 --> 01:45:19.442
Diluted in blood,

01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:23.609
it causes a cardiac 8 hours
after ingestion and leaves no trace.

01:45:45.234 --> 01:45:46.651
Tick-tock.

01:45:46.653 --> 01:45:50.651
